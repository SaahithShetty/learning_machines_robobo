TASK 2
Design/choose an environment with “food” to be “eaten”, e.g., packages to be touched.
You can use the environment models available in scenes/arena_approach.ttt Links to an external site., but you can also modify them or make your own.
An auxiliary script for counting touched packages is available: food.luaLinks to an external site.
Your robot should learn to touch the largest number of packages per minute.
This task includes a competition:
There will be one winning group that will get one extra point for their final grade.
The winner group: the hardware robot collects the largest number of packages in the shortest period.
The verification of the results will be done by your supervisor during your presentation: The supervisor will start a countdown timer (3 minutes) and signal that you can run your script.
The supervisor will register how many packages were collected before the timer goes off.
