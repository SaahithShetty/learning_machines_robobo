# Task 3 Implementation Updates

## Overview
Successfully updated the codebase from Task 2 (Green Food Collection) to Task 3 (Object Pushing to Target Location).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Module Documentation Update**
- Updated header comments from Task 2 to Task 3
- Changed focus from "Green Food Collection" to "Object Pushing to Target Location"
- Updated state space description: 11D → 14D (8 IR + 6 vision features)

### 2. **Computer Vision System - New ObjectPushVisionProcessor**
- **Replaced**: `FoodVisionProcessor` → `ObjectPushVisionProcessor`
- **New Features**:
  - Red object detection (HSV ranges for red color)
  - Green target area detection (HSV ranges for green zones)
  - Dual color detection with wraparound handling for red
  - Object-target spatial relationship analysis
  - Distance and angle estimation for both objects and targets

### 3. **RobotEnvironment Class Updates**
- **State Space**: 11D → 14D
  - Old: `[8 IR + 3 vision]` (food_detected, food_distance, food_angle)
  - New: `[8 IR + 6 vision]` (object_detected, object_distance, object_angle, target_detected, target_distance, target_angle)
- **Episode Time**: 3 minutes → 5 minutes (180s → 300s)
- **Task Tracking**: `food_collected` → `task_completed`
- **Success Criteria**: "7 foods collected" → "object pushed to target"

### 4. **Reward System - Dual Approach**
Implemented sophisticated dual reward system with three modes:

#### **Distance-Based Rewards** (Robot → Object)
- Proximity rewards for getting close to the red object
- Alignment bonuses for facing the object directly
- Forward movement bonuses when object is centered

#### **Target-Based Rewards** (Object → Target)
- Object-target proximity rewards
- Progress tracking over time
- Pushing progress bonuses for moving object closer to target

#### **Hybrid Mode** (Default)
- Combines both distance-based and target-based approaches
- Provides comprehensive guidance throughout the task

### 5. **New Methods Added**
```python
def _get_object_target_state(self):
    """Returns 6D vision state: [obj_detected, obj_dist, obj_angle, target_detected, target_dist, target_angle]"""

def _check_task_completion(self):
    """Checks if red object is successfully positioned in green target area"""

def detect_objects_and_target(self, camera_frame):
    """Detects both red objects and green targets with spatial analysis"""

def get_object_target_relationship(self, camera_frame):
    """Analyzes spatial relationship between objects and targets"""
```

### 6. **Removed Task 2-Specific Methods**
- `_sync_food_count_with_simulation()` - No longer needed
- `_check_food_collision()` - Replaced with task completion logic
- `_get_panoramic_food_state()` - Replaced with object-target state

### 7. **Updated Training/Evaluation Logic**
- **Metrics Tracking**: 
  - `episode_foods_collected` → `episode_task_completions`
  - `best_foods_collected` → `best_task_completion`
- **Success Criteria**: Task completion instead of food count
- **Progress Display**: Shows task completion status instead of food count

### 8. **Main Function Updates**
- `green_food_collection_task2()` → `object_pushing_task3()`
- Updated function calls and documentation
- Vision processor initialization updated
- Episode time limits adjusted

## Technical Specifications

### State Space (14D)
```python
state = [
    # IR Sensors (8D)
    ir_sensor_0, ir_sensor_1, ..., ir_sensor_7,
    
    # Vision Features (6D) 
    object_detected,     # Binary: red object visible [0/1]
    object_distance,     # Normalized distance to object [0-1]
    object_angle,        # Normalized angle to object [-1,1]
    target_detected,     # Binary: green target visible [0/1] 
    target_distance,     # Normalized distance to target [0-1]
    target_angle         # Normalized angle to target [-1,1]
]
```

### Action Space (8D) - Unchanged
```python
actions = [
    (-50, -50),  # 0: Backward
    (-30, 30),   # 1: Turn Left
    (-15, 30),   # 2: Turn Left Slight
    (40, 60),    # 3: Forward Left
    (60, 60),    # 4: Forward
    (60, 40),    # 5: Forward Right
    (30, -15),   # 6: Turn Right Slight
    (30, -30),   # 7: Turn Right
]
```

### Reward Function Hierarchy
1. **Task Completion**: +500 (highest priority)
2. **Object Proximity**: Up to +10 (robot to object)
3. **Object-Target Proximity**: Up to +15 (object to target)
4. **Alignment Bonuses**: Up to +3 (facing correct direction)
5. **Progress Tracking**: Up to +5 (moving object toward target)
6. **Safety Penalties**: -10 (wall collisions)
7. **Behavioral Corrections**: -3 to -5 (spam prevention)

## Usage

The updated system can now be used for Task 3:

```python
# Run Task 3 with different reward modes
results = object_pushing_task3(
    rob=robot,
    agent_type='dqn',
    mode='train',
    num_episodes=100
)

# Environment supports different reward function types
env.reward_function_type = "distance_based"  # Focus on robot-object proximity
env.reward_function_type = "target_based"    # Focus on object-target proximity  
env.reward_function_type = "hybrid"          # Balanced approach (default)
```

## Scene Compatibility

The implementation is designed to work with:
- `arena_push_easy.ttt` - Easier pushing task
- `arena_push_hard.ttt` - More challenging pushing task
- Custom scenes with red objects and green target areas

## Next Steps

1. Test with both easy and hard arena scenes
2. Fine-tune reward function weights based on performance
3. Adjust task completion thresholds if needed
4. Add scene-specific optimizations if required
