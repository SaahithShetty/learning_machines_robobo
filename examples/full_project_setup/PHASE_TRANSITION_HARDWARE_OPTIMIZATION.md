# Phase 1 to Phase 2 Transition Optimization for Hardware Robots

## Issue

The transition from Phase 1 (Object Collection) to Phase 2 (Target Detection) was not working reliably for hardware robots. The issue was that the transition thresholds were optimized for simulation environments but needed adjustment for hardware robots.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Vision-based position detection**: The threshold for detecting when the robot has collected the object (based on the object's Y-position in the camera frame) was too strict for hardware robots (0.85, meaning 85% down the frame).

2. **IR sensor readings**: The required number of close IR readings to trigger the backup transition was too high for hardware robots.

3. **Distance fallback**: The vision-based distance threshold (0.15) for the fallback transition method was too strict for hardware robots.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Hardware-specific Y-position threshold**: 
   - For simulation: 0.85 (85% down the frame)
   - For hardware: 0.75 (75% down the frame)
   - Added debug output showing the current Y-position and threshold

2. **Hardware-specific IR readings requirement**:
   - For simulation: 20 readings below threshold
   - For hardware: 10 readings below threshold (50% of simulation requirement)
   - Added hardware status to transition debug messages

3. **Hardware-specific distance threshold**:
   - For simulation: 0.15 (normalized distance)
   - For hardware: 0.25 (normalized distance)
   - Added hardware status to transition debug messages

4. **Progress reward thresholds**:
   - Adjusted intermediate thresholds for approaching the object to be more lenient for hardware

## Expected Improvements

1. More reliable transitions from Phase 1 to Phase 2 on hardware robots
2. Better debug output to help identify transition issues
3. Maintained compatibility with simulation environments
4. Improved performance in edge cases where vision-based detection might be challenging

## Testing

To test these changes, run the robot in hardware mode and observe:

1. The new debug output showing Y-position and thresholds
2. Transition messages indicating which method triggered the transition
3. Whether the transition happens more reliably at appropriate times

The system should now be more robust to the slight variations in camera positioning and sensor readings that are common in hardware setups compared to simulations.
